YAWU - Yet Another Web Utilities

Rails app with utilities such as JSON converters, HTTP stubs, XSLT transformations and RegEx validators.
* Developed for closed networks (e.g. for enterprise network without internet access)
* Oriented for modern browsers (mostly tested with Firefox 27)
* Uses JRuby, thus can be deployed on almost any Servlet container (e.g. Tomcat, WebSphere) or started as standalone server.
* Can be easily extended with your own tools based on text input and output (using Ajax.org Ace editor) or uploaded files.

TODO list (implemented and planned features):
* ~~XML formatter~~
* ~~XML escaper\unescaper~~
* XPath evaluator
* JSON -> XML converter
* ~~XML -> JSON converter~~
* Unicode entity translator
* JavaScript evaluator (Rhino with configurable Java context)
* ~~XSLT transformations~~
* ~~XSD validation~~ (with XSD definitions placed in multiple files)
* HTTP-service stub (responses configurable status, headers and body)
* etc.
